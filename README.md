# Kynapsee

Kynapsee is a Microsoft PowerPoint plugin, in C#, that let you control a
presentation using Kinect gestures. Not very robust but it does the job.
You can register you own, custom gestures and it uses a Dynamic time warping
(DTW) algorithm to recognise them afterward. Actions can be: next slide,
previous one, black screen...

This project is not maintained anymore.
